# ASAPP Chat Backend Challenge v1
## Overview
This is a TypeScript based boilerplate which runs an HTTP Server configured to answer the endpoints defined in 
[the received challenge](https://backend-challenge.asapp.engineering/).
All endpoints are configured in [src/controllers](https://github.com/Batta32/asapp-challenge/tree/master/src/controllers) folder and if you go deeper to the controllers, you will see the specific implementation of each one.
